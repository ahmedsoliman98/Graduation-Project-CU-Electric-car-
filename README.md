This project aims to develop a prototype fully electric car with self-driving features using image processing. The project is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the driver case, a simulation is used to control the car using a mobile application. The control unit includes a UART communication protocol driver to enable communication with the mobile app via a Bluetooth module. In the second stage, the autonomous driving case, a separate microcontroller (Raspberry Pi) is responsible for image processing and sends data to the main control unit (ATmega32A) to determine motion functions. Motion functions are divided into various speed and directional cases, with forward and reverse functions operating at full speed during autonomous mode. Left and right directional cases are divided into three cases each, with PWM output and Timer 0 & 2 used to control motor angle and speed. This project represents a significant advancement in the development of self-driving electric cars and lays the foundation for future innovation in the field.
